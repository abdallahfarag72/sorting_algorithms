# Sorting Algorithms

This repository is dedicated to practicing the implementation of various sorting algorithms in the C programming language as a part of the ALX SWE Programme curriculum. The time complexity for each algorithm can be found in the corresponding 'O' file.

## Algorithms Included

Currently, this repository includes the following sorting algorithms:

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Quick Sort

Feel free to explore the implementation of each algorithm to deepen your understanding of how they work and their respective time complexities.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abdallahfarag72/sorting_algorithms.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd sorting_algorithms
   ```

3. Compile the C source files using a C compiler of your choice. For example, using GCC:

   ```bash
   gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic  -std=gnu89 1-main.c 1-insertion_sort_list.c print_list.c -o insertion
   ```

4. Run the compiled executable:

   ```bash
   ./insertion
